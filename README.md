- No adaptation for other browsers, but there is responsive design for different screens.
- There are aspects I would improve, but I lacked the time and knowledge.
- In the future, once I master JS, I plan to redo the progress bar.
- I want to add links in the "Work" section to navigate to GitHub for viewing projects.

UPD: 07.10.2024 In fact, I don’t feel like finishing this project because it doesn’t make sense anymore.

However, this project warms my heart with fond memories!
